  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In this recipe we will show you how to make a <strong>DELECTABLE</strong> double cheeseburger!!</p>

  <h2>What you will need:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 hamburger bun, split</li>
      <li>0.5 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
      <li>4 american cheese singles</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon thousand island salad dressing</li>
      <li>1 slice tomato</li>
      <li>1 leaf lettuce</li>
      <li>1 sliced onion</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>How it's done:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat a skillet over medium heat. Lightly toast both halves of the hamburger bun, cut sides down, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Separate beef into 2 portions and form each into a thin patty slightly larger than the bun. Lightly salt each patty and cook on one side for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip patties over and immediately place two slices of American cheese on each one. Cook until meat has reached desired doneness, 2 to 3 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Assemble the double cheeseburger in the following order: bottom bun, dressing, tomato, lettuce, beef patty with cheese, onion, beef patty with cheese, and top bun./li>
      </ol>
